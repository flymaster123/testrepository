            <p>According to the Department of Transportation website, disinsection is allowed by international law to safeguard the environment, agriculture, and public health. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization suggest two techniques for disinsection of aircraft:</p>
            <p>When passengers are present, either (1) spray an aerosolized insecticide into the cabin or (2) treat the interior surfaces of the aircraft with a residual pesticide while no passengers are present. The third approach, which American Samoa has selected, involves spraying an aerosolized insecticide on aircraft while no passengers are present. Although the Informal Consultation on Aircraft Disinsection conducted by the World Health Organization (November 6-10, 1995) concluded that if done correctly, aircraft disinsection would not be harmful to people's health. Some people may experience brief discomfort after aerosol treatment for aircraft disinsection, the paper states. In accordance with the Chicago Convention, which oversees international civil aviation, a government may impose a disinsection requirement if it believes that doing so will impair its public health, agriculture, or environment. As a result, you should speak with a travel agent or airline reservations staff when making flight plans or if you have questions about the policies of your final destination. For further information about disinsection, a list of airlines to contact about disinsection and a list of nations that mandate disinsection, please visit the Department of Transportation's website at the following address: http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.html.</p>

            <p><strong>Travel Service Providers</strong></p>
            <p>Whether such Travel Service Provider is chosen by you or by the Company, you agree to abide by any terms and conditions of offer imposed by any service provider providing services associated with your use of the Website and purchases made on or through the Website, including but not limited to timely payment of all amounts due and compliance with the Travel Service Provider's guidelines and limitations regarding the accessibility and use of fares, goods, or services. You agree that any violation of any such Travel Service Provider's guidelines, limitations, and/or purchase conditions may lead to the following outcomes: cancellation of any made reservations or purchases; refusal to board any aircraft, hotel, or mode of transportation; forfeiture of all monies paid for such reservations or transactions; and debiting of your account by the Company for any costs incurred by the Company as a result of or in connection with such violations. You are completely and entirely responsible for paying any fee, charge, duty, tax, and/or assessment resulting from your use of the website.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that the travel service provider is the only party who can be held accountable for failure to deliver on promises made as a result of the company's bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation.</p>
            <p>The Company is unaware of any specific reservations that are accessible to people with disabilities. To find out if a reservation is appropriate for disabled people, kindly get in touch with the travel service provider directly.</p>

            <p><strong>Track Your Flight</strong></p>
            <p>Passengers are guaranteed a quick and uncomplicated boarding process thanks to the tracking tool Flight Tracker. The service maintains a record of each traveller's flight information and gathers real-time data on flight delays, cancellations, and modifications at the terminal or boarding gate. Travelers are immediately notified through SMS and email of any such changes.</p>
            <p>Contact one of our customer care representatives at our toll-free number if your flight is delayed or cancelled to learn about available flights and useful advice.</p>
            <p>To be clear, Air Legit, a third party, is the provider of this service. In order to establish the status of their flight's departure, tourists are also advised to visit the official website of the relevant airline.</p>
            <p><strong>Exchange Rates and Currency</strong></p>
            <p>Depending on your IP address and/or the currency you choose to use to make the purchase, transactions on the Website frequently take place in various currencies. You will be charged in the indicated currency at the moment of checkout. Please be aware that if you use a debit or credit card to make a purchase on the Website, there may be a difference between the charge we make to your card or the estimated charge amount we give you due to exchange rate fluctuations between the time you make your reservation and the time the charge appears on your credit or debit card statement, which may be calculated using third-party applications.  If we have to credit your account, we'll do so in the exact same currency that was used to make the initial charge. Any exchange rate changes that could cause errors on your debit or credit card statement are not our responsibility. Some banks and credit card companies impose transaction fees on all kinds of transactions, not only international ones. In the event that the payment amount is converted to your local currency, your bank can impose a conversion fee.  This suggests that the amount on your credit card or bank statement can be in your local currency and so be different from the amount shown on the billing summary page for a reservation made on the Website. Booking a trip abroad could be regarded by the bank or credit card provider as an international transaction. Currency conversion rates and foreign transaction fees are set by your bank. If you have questions about these charges or the exchange rate applied to your booking, kindly contact your bank.</p>

            <p><strong>Restrictions on Airlines</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Make changes in rules, travel plans, and prices</strong></p>
            <p>Purchases of airline tickets made on the Website are subject to the published conditions of carriage and rules of the relevant airline and its offering, including but not limited to cancellation policies and other terms of use. When it is issued, the passenger and the applicable airline will be the parties to the contract of carriage. Although schedule alterations may result in an itinerary that breaches the Company's contractual commitments, airlines maintain the right to change flight times and itineraries at any moment. Flights or itineraries may also be altered or cancelled by airlines at their discretion.
            </p>
            <p>In order to provide accurate rates and information for its airline services, the Company makes every effort to publish and maintain accurate rates and information. In exchange, the Airlines provide the Company with prices and other pertinent data. The Company and/or the airline reserve the right to deny or cancel any requests made for a service that is listed by or provided to the Company at an incorrect price or with inaccurate information due to a typographical error or other error in pricing or service information received from an airline before your method of payment is charged.</p>

            <p><strong>Frequent Traveller Points</strong></p>
            <p>Airlines provided by the Company might not be qualified for frequent flyer rewards, upgrades, coupons, or other deals or incentives.</p>

            <p><strong>Code Share</strong></p>
            <p>With other carefully chosen airline partners, airlines frequently enter into "code share" agreements. This indicates that on some routes, the airline marketing or selling the flight does not fly its own aircraft to the destination; rather, a partner airline is hired to fly to the destination. Usually, the partner airline's name is followed by "operated by." In most cases, you will check in with your "operating" carrier; nonetheless, it is a good idea to confirm with your ticketing carrier regarding the location of your flight check-in.</p>

            <p><strong>Hazardous Materials</strong></p>
            <p>Federal legislation prohibits the carrying of hazardous materials in checked baggage or on board an aircraft. A violation might result in up to 10 years in prison and fines of $250,000 or more, depending on the situation (49 U.S.C. 5124). Hazardous materials include things like acids, radioactive substances, flammable liquids, solids, oxidizers, explosives, and poisons.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Prohibited Practices</strong></p>
            <p>If prohibited by the relevant airline, you agree not to buy a ticket (or tickets) that include trip segments you won't use, like "point-beyond," "hidden-city," or "back-to-back tickets." You also agree not to purchase a round-trip ticket that you intend to use solely for one-way travel unless expressly prohibited by the applicable airline. You understand that most airlines forbid using such tickets or engaging in such acts and that we cannot guarantee that the relevant airline will honour your ticket(s) if you do so. You consent to defend the Covered Parties from airline claims for the discrepancy between the full cost of your actual route and the price of the ticket(s) you bought as a result of these or any other prohibited acts.</p>

            <p><strong>Flight Segments</strong></p>
            <p>Flight coupons must be used in a specified order, according to the majority of airlines. You may be required to forfeit the full value of your airline ticket or a lesser portion of it, depending on the policies of the applicable airline for the fare you've paid, if you fail to cancel all or a portion of your flight itinerary or journey before the departure.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxes and Fees on Airline Tickets with a Published Price</strong></p>
            <p>Airlines fees and any applicable taxes and levies are either included in your fare or itemized separately on your checkout page to provide a trip cost. The cost of your ticket is calculated using the tax rate in effect at the time you buy it. Retroactive tax rate increases might be the responsibility of the traveller. For international flights, additional exit and entrance fees that are not included in your travel expenses or that are listed individually on your checkout page may be due. There might be a non-refundable fee per ticket for published-price airline itineraries with multiple carriers. There may be extra charges for your journey on some international flights, including printed ticket fees, cancellation or refund fees, itinerary changes, luggage fees, and entrance or departure taxes. Except for its own income tax, the Company is never subject to any obligation to pay taxes, duties, or fees.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Refunds and Cancellations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The price of plane tickets and the service costs collected for purchase are not refundable after 24 hours.</li>
                <li>There will, however, be a cancellation fee.</li>
                <li>Calling our 24-hour customer care line will allow you to cancel your tickets for a fee within 24 hours of your purchase.</li>
                <li>If you don't show up for your flight, the airline loses the whole cost of the ticket. To avoid a no-show, kindly get in touch with us at least 4 hours before the flight's departure.</li>
                <li>Airline regulations prohibit changing the passenger name(s) after a ticket has been purchased. Any changes to the itinerary are restricted and are subject to the restrictions of the specific airline.</li>
                <li>When bought within 7 days (168 hours) before the departure date, all cheap airline tickets are non-refundable. Under no circumstances is the amount paid for hotel and rental car reservations refundable. On the other hand, service fees for hotel and rental vehicle reservations might be refundable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Reservation cancellations for flights must always be made by phone. The following prerequisites must be satisfied before a refund request may be taken into consideration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the terms of the tariff permit it and you have asked us for a cancellation and refund.</li>
                <li>If you don't attend, you will be a "no-show." A "no show" occurs when a passenger does not show up at the airport when the plane is supposed to leave and gives the airline no other information. A "no show" booking typically disqualifies the supplier from waiving any refund processing fees.</li>
                <li>We are able to secure waivers from suppliers as we process the requested cancellation and reimbursement. We probably won't be able to do that forever, though.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The amount of time it might take to process the requested refund cannot be specifically estimated by us. After submitting your cancellation request to our customer service representative, you will receive an email from us confirming receipt of your request. However, even getting a notification does not ensure that you will get a refund. A tracking number and a simple confirmation that your request has been received are all that are included in the email message. If your cancellation and refund request qualifies for a refund, we will only get in touch with vendors like airlines, hotels, and rental car companies to generate a waiver. The supplier's choice shall be final, and we shall notify you of such.</p>

            <p><strong>There are options for seats, meals, frequent flier points, and other specific requirements.</strong></p>
            <p>You should be aware that any special requests you make for seats, meals, frequent flyer points, or anything else will only be fulfilled upon request. If you need to cancel, we charge a service fee of up to $10 and pay seat charges for putting in such a special request on your behalf. We don't guarantee that you'll get the seat(s) you requested, so please don't hold us accountable for that. In the same vein, we cannot guarantee that the airline will comply with your meal(s), frequent flyer, or other special requirements. Therefore, it is strongly advised that you get in touch with the appropriate airline immediately to get these requests confirmed before the flight's scheduled departure date.</p>

            <p><strong>Baggage Fees and Policy</strong></p>
            <p>It is strongly encouraged to travel light in order to save money on baggage fees because the majority of airlines now levy a cost even for the first checked bag. To find out more about the baggage fees charged by each airline, visit our page on baggage fees. The airline's luggage policy will determine whether you will be charged an excess baggage fee if you have extra baggage. Depending on the size, weight, and amount of bags, different airlines have different baggage policies and may charge anywhere from $15 to $200 or more. Our service fee, which can be up to $12, and luggage costs for some flights, however, are not refundable in the event of a cancellation. We make every effort to offer the most recent data on luggage charges. For the most recent baggage rules, it is strongly advised that you speak with the airline directly.</p>
            <p>If you use particular services or go over certain limits set by the airline, several airline companies may charge you extra fees at the airport. Additionally, some airlines don't offer any free luggage allowance. Each airline should be contacted directly throughout the booking process for complete information on baggage and any applicable additional costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Fees for entry and exit</strong></p>
            <p>Some nations or airports levy a fee for travellers entering and leaving their territory. The cost of the ticket, as well as any applicable fees or taxes, are not inclusive of these costs. You agree that you are accountable for paying all related fees. We advise visiting www.travel.state.gov before your departure for further details on the fees for entering and leaving each country.</p>

            <p><strong>Limitation on Time to File Claims</strong></p>
            <p>Any claim you may have for damages stemming from or connected to these terms of use or the website must be initiated within one (1) year of the cause of action arising. Otherwise, it will be permanently barred.</p>

            <p><strong>Waiver and Severability</strong></p>
            <p>Any waiver by the Company of a term or condition stated in these Terms of Use shall not constitute a further or continuing waiver of that term or condition or of any other term or condition. Likewise, the Company's failure to exercise a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The remaining terms of the Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect in the event that any provision of this Agreement of Use is determined by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, and such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary.</p>

            <p><strong>Credit/Debit Cards</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Credit/debit cards from the US, Canada, and a few other nations are accepted by the business. Additionally acceptable are billing addresses for AE/AP.</li>
                <li>Please be aware that your credit/debit card may be charged more than once; the total and final amount you will be responsible for paying will be the sum of those charges.</li>

                <li>If for any reason your credit/debit card or other form of payment is not accepted or processed, you will be informed within 24 hours. Non-credit/debit card payment methods could take longer than 24 hours.</li>

                <li>Prior to the successful conclusion of the payment process, you may also receive notice of any changes to the flight fare or other modifications. Remember that you can only approve or reject this transaction after being informed of the change. If you decide against this transaction, no money will be taken from your credit or debit card.</li>

                <li>Reservations for hotels and rental cars are only considered finalized when full confirmation information is delivered to the email address you provided at the time of reservation. In order to receive confirmation for some reservations, prepayment may be necessary.</li>

                <li>If our analytical algorithms indicate that a transaction poses a high danger to your online safety, we may choose not to complete it. These payments won't go through unless our credit card verification team concludes that they are secure. To verify the legitimacy of such transactions, we might get in touch with you, your bank, or the provider of your credit or debit card.</li>
            </ul>
